# Usage

Clone project and open within IDE (preferrably VS Code)

## Prerequisites

Make sure to use Yarn and not npx.

After opening the project within IDE,
Open the terminal.

### Install yarn

npm install --global yarn

or other installation options from
https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install

### Check version (should be 1.22.19)

yarn --version

## Install Dependencies

yarn

## Add environment variables

Create an .env file in the root of the project, and add the proper variables.

## Start the project

Make sure to only run the project with the command:

yarn expo start

Other commands may seem to work but may cause weird errors down the road.

## Testing

Either use a simulator through XCode or something similar.

Preferrably use your phone by downloading Expo Go, creating an account,
then scan the QR code provided in the terminal.
